# Hi, ðŸ‘‹ my name is Maks.
## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Support Ukrainian Army - [https://savelife.in.ua/donate/](https://savelife.in.ua/donate/)

## About me :technologist:
I'm a software engineer with deep knowledge of infrastructure. I believe that DevOps is a mindset we all should follow, not a job title. 

I participate in open-source projects and live by the philosophy of "everything as code." I approach business needs with product thinking and automate wherever possible to eliminate routine tasks.

I have a homelab built with Mikrotik network devices and mini PCs. There I continuously hone my skills by hosting pet projects, smarthome tools, and automations.

I'm currently working as a DevOps engineer at [VITech](https://vitechteam.com/vacancies).


## My technology stack:
```bash
Clouds:
AWS, Hetzner Cloud

IaC and configuration management:
Terraform, Ansible

Containers:
Docker, Compose, Kubernetes

Programming and scripting languages:
Python, Typescript, Bash, Go

Frameworks:
FastAPI, NextJS

Automations:
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
```
<br>

I can help you: start new products, select appropriate technology stacks, create efficient processes, identify and resolve bottlenecks
